.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-create\-device\-config\fR
Discovers all devices in your network and write a config for them.
That config can be editied manually to adjust various settings.
You can set:
.IP
\- Device name
\- Codec order (The first one is used if the encoder binary is available on your system)
\- Various codec settings such as the mime type, specific rules or
.IP
the bit rate (depends on the codec)
.IP
A written config is loaded by default if the \fB\-\-encoder\fR and \fB\-\-bit\-rate\fR options are not used.
.TP
\fB\-\-host=\fR<host>
Set the server ip.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR \fB\-\-port=\fR<port>
Set the server port [default: 8080].
.TP
\fB\-e\fR \fB\-\-encoder=\fR<encoders>
Set the audio encoder.
Possible encoders are:
.TP
\- mp3
MPEG Audio Layer III (MP3)
.TP
\- ogg
Ogg Vorbis (OGG)
.TP
\- flac
Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)
.TP
\- wav
Waveform Audio File Format (WAV)
.TP
\- opus
Opus Interactive Audio Codec (OPUS)
.TP
\- aac
Advanced Audio Coding (AAC)
.TP
\- l16
Linear PCM (L16)
.TP
\fB\-b\fR \fB\-\-bit\-rate=\fR<rate>
Set the audio encoder's bitrate.
.TP
\fB\-\-filter\-device=\fR<filter\-device>
Set a name filter for devices which should be added.
Devices which get discovered, but won't match the
filter text will be skipped.
.TP
\fB\-\-renderer\-urls=\fR<urls>
Set the renderer urls yourself. no discovery will commence.
.TP
\fB\-\-request\-timeout=\fR<timeout>
Set the timeout for requests in seconds [default: 10].
.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fR
enables detailed debug messages.
.TP
\fB\-\-fake\-http\-content\-length\fR
If set, the content\-length of HTTP requests will be set to 100 GB.
.TP
\fB\-\-disable\-switchback\fR
If set, streams won't switched back to the default sink if a device disconnects.
.TP
\fB\-\-disable\-ssdp\-listener\fR
If set, the application won't bind to the port 1900 and therefore the automatic discovery of new devices won't work.
.TP
\fB\-\-disable\-device\-stop\fR
If set, the application won't send any stop commands to renderers at all
.TP
\fB\-v\fR \fB\-\-version\fR
Show the version.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR \fB\-\-help\fR
Show the help.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
\- pulseaudio\-dlna
.IP
will start pulseaudio\-dlna on port 8080 and stream your PulseAudio streams encoded with mp3.
.IP
\- pulseaudio\-dlna \-\-encoder ogg
.IP
will start pulseaudio\-dlna on port 8080 and stream your PulseAudio streams encoded with Ogg Vorbis.
.IP
\- pulseaudio\-dlna \-\-port 10291 \-\-encoder flac
.IP
will start pulseaudio\-dlna on port 10291 and stream your PulseAudio streams encoded with FLAC.
.IP
\- pulseaudio\-dlna \-\-filter\-device 'Nexus 5,TV'
.IP
will just use devices named Nexus 5 or TV even when more devices got discovered.
.IP
\- pulseaudio\-dlna \-\-renderer\-urls http://192.168.1.7:7676/smp_10_
.IP
won't discover upnp devices by itself. Instead it will search for upnp renderers
at the specified locations. You can specify multiple locations via urls
separated by comma (,). Most users won't ever need this option, but since
UDP multicast packages won't work (most times) over VPN connections this is
very useful if you ever plan to stream to a UPNP device over VPN.

is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If the
.B info
and
.B pulseaudio-dlna
programs are properly installed at your site, the command
